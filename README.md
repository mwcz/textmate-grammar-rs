# textmate-grammar-rs

WIP: Draft: NotYetImplemented: a Rust parser for TextMate grammar files.

All that can currently be done with this is run some tests which attempt to parse all the TextMate grammar files from [Shiki](https://github.com/shikijs/shiki).

To see the coverage:

```
cargo test -- --nocapture
```
